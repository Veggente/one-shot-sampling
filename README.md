# one-shot-sampling
Simulation code for one-shot sampling paper

These scripts are used to generate the main simulation figures in [the bioRxiv paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/537548) titled "Time series experimental design under one-shot sampling: The importance of condition diversity".
* `plot_plos_one_fig_4()` in `mle_on_glm.py` generates Fig. 4.  The estimated wall time is 240 hours.
* `plot_plos_one_fig_5_6()` in `bslr.py` generates Figs. 5 and 6.  The estimated wall time is 160 hours.
* `plot_plos_one_fig_7()` in `bslr.py` generates Fig. 7.  The estimated wall time is 2 hours.
